# RangeBoundDatePicker

**RangeBoundDatePicker** is a versatile custom control crafted for PowerApps Component Framework (PCF) that simplifies date selection and validation. In the world of Dynamics 365 CRM, managing date ranges and applying constraints can be complex. Whether you need to:

- Ensure users select dates within a specific range
- Avoid weekends
- Exclude certain dates

Traditionally, implementing these validations requires extensive coding and custom logic. With **RangeBoundDatePicker**, these challenges become effortless.

This innovative control offers a dynamic and user-friendly solution for enforcing date constraints directly within your application. By leveraging this control, you can easily configure:

- **Custom Date Ranges**: Define precise start and end dates, or set flexible boundaries that adjust based on today's date.
- **Day Exclusions**: Automatically disable weekends or specific days, ensuring that users only select valid dates.
- **Dynamic Date Adjustments**: Customize past and future date ranges dynamically to fit your application’s needs.

Gone are the days of writing intricate validation code. **RangeBoundDatePicker** streamlines the process, offering a configurable and intuitive interface that enhances user experience while ensuring data integrity. Transform how you handle date selections with this robust and adaptable control.

## Features

- **Date and Time Selection**: Enables users to select dates with customizable constraints.
- **Range Configuration**: Choose between a specific duration or a flexible time frame for date selection.
- **Dynamic Date Ranges**: Configure past and future durations relative to the current date.
- **Disabled Days**: Disable specific days or dates in the calendar.
- **Text Input**: Optionally allow users to enter dates manually.
- **Month Picker Overlay**: Show the month picker as an overlay on the date picker.
- **Week Numbers**: Optionally display week numbers in the calendar.

## Build From Source

Before building the control make sure the following tools are available on your PATH:

- Node.js (use the latest LTS release via `nvm use --lts`)
- .NET SDK 8.0 or later (`dotnet --version`)
- Power Platform CLI (`pac`) version 1.31.6 or newer

Once the prerequisites are in place run the steps below from the repository root:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build` – compiles the control into `out/controls`
3. `npm run pack` – generates Dataverse solution ZIPs in `dist/`

The packaging step produces both managed and unmanaged solution files:

- `dist/RangeBoundDatePicker_Unmanaged.zip`
- `dist/RangeBoundDatePicker_Managed.zip`

## Deploy To Dataverse

Import the managed or unmanaged ZIP from `dist/` into your Dataverse environment (`Solutions > Import`). After the solution imports successfully, open the form designer for the table you want to enhance, add the **RangeBoundDatePicker** control to a date column, configure the properties, and publish your changes.

## Customization

- **Function Overrides**: Customize the RangeBoundDatePicker control’s behavior using the provided functions. The control exposes methods through the global **`pcfDateControl_{logicalNameofField}`** object, allowing you to adapt its functionality to your specific needs:

   - **dateRange(minDate: Date, maxDate: Date)** : Use this method to update the `minimum` and `maximum` date boundaries for the control. Pass `minDate` and `maxDate` as Date objects to configure the date range, and call this method during the form’s `onLoad` event to set the boundaries dynamically.
   - **restrictedDates(dates: Date[])**: This method enables you to specify dates that should be restricted or disabled within the control. By passing an array of Date objects, the control will normalize these `dates` and apply the restrictions accordingly. You can dynamically set or update these restricted dates during runtime, for instance, on the form’s `onLoad` event.
